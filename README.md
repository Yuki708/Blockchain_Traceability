# Blockchain_Traceability
Paper name: Multi-blockchain traceability architecture for minimizing  bogus data in insider threat detection
This project packs different experimental contents into different folders, including the project code and the corresponding "readme". The experimental dataset will be mentioned in the dataset.
The blockchain-test folder is for testing experiments of blockchain-related functions, including blockchain upload efficiency, block generation time, and block consensus delay between nodes. In the CERT insider threat dataset, CERt-Test selects email.csv dataset to carry out large sample data upload and traceability experiments on blockchain. Schonlau-test is a data upload and traceability experiment on blockchain conducted on schonlau dataset (50 records).
